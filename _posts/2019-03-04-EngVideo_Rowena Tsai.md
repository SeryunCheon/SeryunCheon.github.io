hey how u guys doin'? So before we get started I wanna first show u guys something. This is what i do evey weekend when i ndeed to film. I put evthing that was on my dest on the floor, so that it"s out of frame, so that it looks claen and nice behind me. When I film from this angle exactly a little behind the scenes. SO today I'm going to really put my house and my outer world in order. So that i can really put my inner world in order as well . Hopefully this is the last cleaning vlog I make for a while bcuz the goal of this tiding and organizing session is to keeep my apartment this way. not just for two hours before the weeks to come<br><br>

First thig I like doing is to put evthing back where they belong. This is sth that 콘 마뤼(미니멀리스트) talks as well of grouping all the things together. So I hava a lot of skin-care products outside in my hallway bcuz I'm a host on "beauty within", which is a skin-care and beauty channel so there's a lot of products i need to try out bcuz it's a part of my job. It's a little excessive, actually It's very excessive, the amount of the skincare I currently have. This is just the one part of it. So the thing is, when I saw all of this I got very overwhelmed. I didn't wanna deal whith this. So instead of dealing with it, I put it off for later and I did sth else that I really wannted to do which is the vaccum. I already talked about how much i love this dyson-wireless vacum so, I'm not gonna get into it too much but. It's kind of like, if u dont wanna do sth and u know you donyt wanna do tit, find sth else that u know... u would be happy with doing it. Alright that all i could do on Saturday. I spend the rest of day, reading and catching up on just a lot of things that I've been into catch up on, specifically reading bcuz I just haven't had time so you know? I'm making timme<br><br>
So this is Sunday I'm going through every single article of clothing that i have. Taking everything out, putting on the bed, touching eevery single thing I've own and seeing every single that i own. I feel like psychologicallu it really helps to see how much you actually own, throw everything on your bed or whatever it is that you're cleaning and this is actually sth that i haven't done in ad really long time. maybe over a year? I 콘 마뤼(동사로쓰임. 마치 구글을 구글링하다 동사로 쓰듯), probably every season but I haven't actually removed all my clothings from the racks in a really long time
